## General
The best way to start this off is to start off with arduino sketches because that will be easiest to integrate into existing hardware.
## Features Needed
-Algorithms to convert vector drawings into something usable  
-Way to interface with app  
-Hardware controller  
## Info
I'm just throwing something up quickly so people can get started, once I have some more free time, or somebody has a decent proof of concept, I can get other people to help manage this project and add more restrictions to formatting.
